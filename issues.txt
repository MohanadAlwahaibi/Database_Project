1- i faced problem when i try to insert 'Male' , 'female'
because i have decleared for gender varchar(1) 

i fixed it by typing 'M' , 'F'


2- i faced problem when inserting phone number
the phone number was 12 char long , and i have declear it as 8 varchar

the fix that i use is 

alter table trainee
alter column phone varchar(100)

the fix i there is a typo mistake.
